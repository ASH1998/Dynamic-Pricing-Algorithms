## so for these models we have a set of assumptions...

(i) the number of potential customers is not
limited, and as a consequence, the size of the population is not a parameter of the
model  
(ii) only one type of item is concerned  
(iii) a monopoly situation is considered    
(iv) customers buy items as soon as the price is less than or equal to
the price they are prepared to pay (myopic customers). A deterministic model with
time-dated items is presented and illustrated first.    

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this model, the relationship
between the price per item and demand is established. Then, the
stochastic version of the same model is analyzed. A Poisson process generates
customersâ€™ arrivals. Finally, a stochastic model with salvage value where the price
is a function of inventory level is considered    


## SUMMARY  
This provides an insight into mathematical pricing models.
### Note  
That few convenient models exist without the assumptions presented
above, that is to say a monopoly situation, an infinite number of potential customers
who are myopic and no supply option. Negative
exponential functions are often used to make the model manageable and few
persuasive arguments are proposed to justify this choice: this is why we consider
that most of these models are more useful to understand dynamic pricing than to
treat real-life situations.
